As such, it was a proper showing of disguts with leadership.	Of course, as a United States citizen, I would love to say I would be on the colonists side. However, if my situation was the same as it is today, it is likely that I would have been a Torey myself. Just the statistics speaking there.	The Parliment was heavy-handed in this instance. Their policies were wide sweep and restrictive. There should have been a target act on Boston itself and a serious attempt at arrests. Then it would have been smart to listen to the frustrations of the people. This whole mess could have been prevented if more care had be given to the colonists.
