Ain't nothing but the brave standing between freedom and tyranny!	Those filthy british should have left us alone from the start. They shouldn't have interferred.
@Tea_Times_Anonymous	15:53, 27th June 2025	I don't know if destroying the tea was the best idea. Everything I've read in the founders documents looks loike they preffered peaceful protest. This seems a little to violent.	I wouldn't have done anything to stop them. I am a bystander now and I'd be a bystander then to.	Parliament brought the law down. I don't see wh y any reasonable government wouldn't do the same. Look at today. Our current president is doin the same thing.
@PolicyGe3k1789	13:52, 7th June 2025	Whilst there was destruction of property, these men conducted themselve properly. No person was harmed in this protest. As such, it was a proper showing of disguts with leadership.	Of course, as a United States citizen, I would love to say I would be on the colonists side. However, if my situation was the same as it is today, it is likely that I would have been a Torey myself. Just the statistics speaking there.	The Parliament was heavy-handed in this instance. Their policies were wide sweep and restrictive. There should have been a target act on Boston itself and a serious attempt at arrests. Then it would have been smart to listen to the frustrations of the people. This whole mess could have been prevented if more care had be given to the colonists.
@eagle_echo	16:31, 27th June 2025	Your such a big ***** @Tea_Times_Anonymous. Sam Adams himself was there and was certainly no *****! 	What are you going to do when comes for your rights and takes a big ***** on your head? Pathetic! Are you going to stand idly by. Not me!	Those guys were massive ***** and wouldn't be any different today.
