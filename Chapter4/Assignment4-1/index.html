        <h3>Parent Britain Punishes Disobedient Son's of Liberty</h3>
        <p>
            On December 16th, 1773, the Son's of Liberty, led by Samuel Adams,
            having enough of Britain's tyranical rule, struck back. In the evening,
            a group of 30 to 130 men, some donning Mohawk warrior disguises,
            illegaly boarded three shipping vessels containing tea. Over the course
            of the next three hours, they dumped 342 containers of tea int the water.
            This amounted to £9,659 (equivalent to £1,550,322 in 2023 or $1,700,000
            today) in damages to the British East India Company.

            Another tea ship intended for Boston, the William, ran aground at Cape Cod in December 1773, and its tea was taxed and sold to private parties. In March 1774, the Sons of Liberty received information that this tea was being held in a warehouse in Boston, entered the warehouse and destroyed all they could find. Some of it had already been sold to Davison, Newman and Co. and was being held in their shop. On March 7, Sons of Liberty once again dressed as Mohawks, broke into the shop, and dumped the last remaining tea into the harbor.[76][77]
